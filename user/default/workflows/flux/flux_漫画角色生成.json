v1\n\nCharacter Overview\nA full-body female character stands facing forward with the poised grace of a runway model. Her look merges gothic visual language with rich Chinese traditional design. She wears a muted brick-red top and a striking Mamian skirt adorned with ornate patterns inspired by lacquered banquet ware from the Western Han and Warring States periods, creating a culturally layered and visually commanding presence.\n\nFace Features\nHer skin is porcelain-pale with a cool tone, emphasizing a gothic aesthetic. Makeup features dark eyeliner, light gray shading around the eyes, and deep plum lipstick. Her face bears no blush, maintaining a cold and statuesque elegance. Oversized copper coin earrings hang dramatically from her ears, featuring detailed engravings and concentric ring elements for heightened visual impact.\n\nHairstyle\nHer black hair is styled with a youthful center part and thick, soft bangs that graze her eyebrows. Twin buns sit above each ear, secured with red floral ornaments. Long, flowing sections cascade from the buns to her waist, creating fullness and movement in the silhouette.\n\nClothing\nShe wears a cropped dark brick-red blouse with semi-sheer, voluminous sleeves gathered by black ribbon cuffs. A sleek black faux-leather necktie adds structure. Her waist is cinched by a wide black leather belt featuring silver metal rings and studs. The highlight is her black Mamian skirt, where the traditional pleated structure meets historic-inspired ornamentation: across its front panels, patterns drawn from Western Han and Warring States lacquer trays gradually evolve from minimal geometric lines at the top into dense, complex compositions at the bottom—featuring spirals, mythic animal forms, and cloud motifs in subdued gold and wine red, echoing ancient banquet artistry.\n\nBody Features\nShe has a tall and slender build with graceful proportions. Her elegant, poised stance amplifies her refined, spectral presence.\n\nPose\nShe walks forward with a calm, fluid motion, her skirt swaying with controlled energy. Her arms rest at her sides and her chin tilts downward slightly, reinforcing her enigmatic poise.\n\nShoes\nShe wears traditional-style black leather platform shoes with a square toe and subtle polish. White lace-edged socks peek out from above the shoes, softening the darker palette and adding balance to the ensemble."],"color":"#432","bgcolor":"#653"},{"id":13,"type":"SamplerCustomAdvanced","pos":[418,278],"size":[272.3617858886719,124.53733825683594],"flags":{},"order":18,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"localized_name":"噪波","name":"noise","type":"NOISE","link":37},{"localized_name":"引导器","name":"guider","type":"GUIDER","link":30},{"localized_name":"采样器","name":"sampler","type":"SAMPLER","link":19},{"localized_name":"西格玛","name":"sigmas","type":"SIGMAS","link":20},{"localized_name":"Latent图像","name":"latent_image","type":"LATENT","link":116}],"outputs":[{"localized_name":"Latent","name":"output","shape":3,"type":"LATENT","slot_index":0,"links":[24]},{"localized_name":"降噪Latent","name":"denoised_output","shape":3,"type":"LATENT","links":null}],"properties":{"cnr_id":"comfy-core","ver":"0.3.29","Node name for S&R":"SamplerCustomAdvanced"},"widgets_values":[]},{"id":8,"type":"VAEDecode","pos":[786,334],"size":[210,46],"flags":{},"order":19,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"localized_name":"Latent","name":"samples","type":"LATENT","link":24},{"localized_name":"vae","name":"vae","type":"VAE","link":12}],"outputs":[{"localized_name":"图像","name":"IMAGE","type":"IMAGE","slot_index":0,"links":[9]}],"properties":{"cnr_id":"comfy-core","ver":"0.3.29","Node name for S&R":"VAEDecode"},"widgets_values":[]},{"id":35,"type":"PrimitiveNode","pos":[672,480],"size":[210,82],"flags":{},"order":7,"mode":0,"inputs":[],"outputs":[{"name":"INT","type":"INT","widget":{"name":"height"},"slot_index":0,"links":[113,114]}],"title":"height","properties":{"Run widget replace on values":false},"widgets_values":[1280,"fixed"],"color":"#323","bgcolor":"#535"},{"id":34,"type":"PrimitiveNode","pos":[432,480],"size":[210,82],"flags":{},"order":8,"mode":0,"inputs":[],"outputs":[{"name":"INT","type":"INT","widget":{"name":"width"},"slot_index":0,"links":[112,115]}],"title":"width","properties":{"Run widget replace on values":false},"widgets_values":[800,"fixed"],"color":"#323","bgcolor":"#535"},{"id":27,"type":"EmptySD3LatentImage","pos":[480,624],"size":[315,106],"flags":{},"order":12,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"name":"width","type":"INT","widget":{"name":"width"},"link":112},{"name":"height","type":"INT","widget":{"name":"height"},"link":113}],"outputs":[{"localized_name":"Latent","name":"LATENT","shape":3,"type":"LATENT","slot_index":0,"links":[116]}],"properties":{"cnr_id":"comfy-core","ver":"0.3.29","Node name for S&R":"EmptySD3LatentImage"},"widgets_values":[800,1280,4]},{"id":25,"type":"RandomNoise","pos":[480,768],"size":[315,82],"flags":{},"order":9,"mode":0,"inputs":[],"outputs":[{"localized_name":"噪波","name":"NOISE","shape":3,"type":"NOISE","links":[37]}],"properties":{"cnr_id":"comfy-core","ver":"0.3.29","Node name for S&R":"RandomNoise"},"widgets_values":[466462581264365,"randomize"],"color":"#2a363b","bgcolor":"#3f5159"},{"id":9,"type":"SaveImage","pos":[894.8493041992188,483.9798889160156],"size":[1303.30126953125,628.3828125],"flags":{},"order":20,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"localized_name":"图片","name":"images","type":"IMAGE","link":9}],"outputs":[],"properties":{"cnr_id":"comfy-core","ver":"0.3.29","Node name for S&R":"SaveImage"},"widgets_values":["秋人_变身前"]},{"id":6,"type":"CLIPTextEncode","pos":[925,175],"size":[1135.844970703125,257.31304931640625],"flags":{},"order":10,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"localized_name":"clip","name":"clip","type":"CLIP","link":10}],"outputs":[{"localized_name":"条件","name":"CONDITIONING","type":"CONDITIONING","slot_index":0,"links":[41]}],"title":"CLIP Text Encode (Positive Prompt)","properties":{"cnr_id":"comfy-core","ver":"0.3.29","Node name for S&R":"CLIPTextEncode"},"widgets_values":["Character Overview\nA slim, full-body male figure stands facing forward with a relaxed yet deliberate presence. His posture is loose, but his sharp gaze and bold monochrome outfit with minimal color accents reflect quiet confidence and stylistic precision.\n\nFace Features\nHe has a slender, pale face with a pointed chin and eyes that are sharp and focused. His brows are subtly drawn, enhancing the clarity in his gaze. His lips are thin and set in a calm, unreadable line. A single silver earring and faint under-eye shadows give his face added depth.\n\nHairstyle\nHis hair is short and slightly tousled, matte black with subtle layering for shape and volume. Clean lines and a natural texture frame his face, contributing to his low-effort, sharp look.\n\nClothing\nHe wears a black oversized zip-up jacket with white star motifs on the sleeves and chest. The jacket is unzipped, revealing a crisp white fitted T-shirt underneath. His pants are jet black, slightly baggy, with light distressing and functional white drawstrings. His high-top sneakers are stark black and white, with small vivid red accents on the heels and laces for contrast. A slim silver chain with a bright red charm hangs around his neck as the only color highlight.\n\nBody Features\nHe has a tall, slender build with long limbs and narrow shoulders. His form is relaxed and naturally balanced, free from tension but never slouched to the point of weakness—conveying subtle control.\n\nPose\nHe stands with his feet shoulder-width apart, hands casually in the pockets of his open jacket. His head tilts slightly forward, shoulders relaxed. His body exudes stillness, but his gaze remains direct and composed, bridging laziness and latent readiness."],"color":"#232","bgcolor":"#353"}],"links":[[9,8,0,9,0,"IMAGE"],[10,11,0,6,0,"CLIP"],[12,10,0,8,1,"VAE"],[19,16,0,13,2,"SAMPLER"],[20,17,0,13,3,"SIGMAS"],[24,13,0,8,0,"LATENT"],[30,22,0,13,1,"GUIDER"],[37,25,0,13,0,"NOISE"],[41,6,0,26,0,"CONDITIONING"],[42,26,0,22,1,"CONDITIONING"],[54,30,0,22,0,"MODEL"],[55,30,0,17,0,"MODEL"],[112,34,0,27,0,"INT"],[113,35,0,27,1,"INT"],[114,35,0,30,2,"INT"],[115,34,0,30,1,"INT"],[116,27,0,13,4,"LATENT"],[117,12,0,38,0,"MODEL"],[118,38,0,39,0,"*"],[119,39,0,30,0,"MODEL"]],"groups":[],"config":{},"extra":{"ds":{"scale":1.2100000000000002,"offset":[-212.09585713407682,-163.35245514526474]},"groupNodes":{},"node_versions":{"comfy-core":"v0.3.10-44-g2ff3104f","Comfy-WaveSpeed":"21140cdf8c43946acd9ea522b4fda66df5d859c9"},"VHS_latentpreview":false,"VHS_latentpreviewrate":0,"ue_links":[],"VHS_MetadataImage":true,"VHS_KeepIntermediate":true},"version":0.4}
